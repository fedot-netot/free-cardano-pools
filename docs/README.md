# Cardano FREE stake pools

This is the Cardano Free stake pools home page.

Our team of Cardano enthusiasts is happy to welcome you! We have supported the operation of several stake pools in the ITN network since the very first days of this test network. Now after the transition of the main Cardano network to the Shelley era, we are happy to invite you to the wonderful world of decentralization.

We won't reveal a secret if we say that maintaining a pool is now a fairly simple task for an IT specialist. For us, maintaining the pool and supporting the Cardano network is more of a hobby and fun than a profitable project, at least for the next year or two. Therefore, we intend to keep the pool margin equal to 0% until the pool becomes saturated (we hope that this will happen sometime). Our plan is to support our pools responsibly and earn a reputation as a reliable pool among delegates.

Now we have registered a stake pool with the Ticker `FREE1` and *ID*: `5254329935732eb7c5e674ae1930942056357a801a81823666a7a563` in the main Cardano network.
